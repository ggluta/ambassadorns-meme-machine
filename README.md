# Devtest Readme

Hello candidate, Welcome to our little dev test. The goal of
this exercise, is to asses your general skill level, and give
us something to talk about at our next appointment.


## What this app should do

We'd like for you to build a tiny app called the "Vintage Meme
Machine". It will be a tool that allows users to overlay text
on a video, and capture or share it.

__These are the basic requirements:__

- User can pick a point in the video                    
- User can enter text that is placed __over__ the video _still_                                
- User can save this personalized content to the server, for later use
- User can retrieve their meme via an url
        
## What we want you to do

Off course we don't expect you to build a full fledged app
in such a short time frame.                  

But we would like for you to get in the basic requirements,
in one form or another. Beyond that feel free to show off
your strenghts as a frontend developer.

__Some ideas:__

- Make it look really nice
- Allow users to provide a custom video
- Make the server secure enough to deploy
- Download the meme as an image file
- Add super cool text effects to the text overlay
- Push the resulting meme to a social media API

_P.s. We've already added some libraries to make your life easier (Create React App, Redux, Jss, React Router, Express), but feel free to add more._

## Get start

### `npm start`
To start developing the frontend in /src/index.js on port 3000

### `npm server`
To start developing the server in /server/index.js on port 8000


## From react app:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
